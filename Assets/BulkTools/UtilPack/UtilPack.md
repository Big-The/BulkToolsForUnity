# Util Pack Module

## About
This module acts as the miscellaneous module, and will be where I put any tools that seem to small to bother with giving them their own module.
It includes multiple simple util extension methods, and variable types.
Expanded systems include: 
- List Extensions (Shuffling)
- RandomExtras (Sequences, Weighted Random)
- SerializableTypes (Type selection in the inspector)
