# Asset Replacement Module

## About
Asset Replacement provides a simple way to quickly replace assets without impacting references by keeping the same GUID for the new asset.
It can replace assets keeping the old name or using the name of the replacement.

## Platforms
Editor Only

## How to Use
Simply right click on an asset in the project folder and select "Replace/Keep Old Name" or "Replace/Use New Name".

### Keep Old Name Option
Using this option will replace the file with the data of the new file using the original name of the asset.

### Use New Name Option
Using this option will replace the file with the new file entirely.

## Not Yet Supported
The replace feature does not yet support operating in mass, eg replacing a folder of assets all at once. This is planned.
